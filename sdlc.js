// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const Analysis = "This is the second step, identify all overall requirements of the clients needs. This is cruicial to ensure software functions properly at the end."
const Design = "This is the third step, where building of the project begins. This specificies program language, setting up software stack, platforms, and overall programing."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, where we begin running the developed software. This helps us see possible coding errors, and any areas that need improvement or changes to ensure customer is satisfied and getting the product they want."
const Testing = "This is the fifth step, this is where we test run the software to see any software errors or bugs. This is also when you will implement the UI/UX Design, so you can see point of view from the users end."
const Maintain = "This is the final step, the product is released. Now this is where we do upgrades to adapt to any changes, and make sure the software stays consistent and working."
